    "# Environmental Chemistry Lab - Scale Height of the Atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will work individually to measure the scale height of the atmosphere. This is the mathematical parameter that describes the $e$-folding height of the atmosphere â€” the altitude at which pressure has dropped to $\\frac{1}{e}$ or $\\approx 33\\%$ of its sea-level value. The equation relating scale height and atmospheric pressure is\n",
    " \n",
    "$P = P_0 e^{\\frac{-\\Delta z}{H}}$\n",
    " \n",
    "Where $P$ is the pressure at a given altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_0$ is the pressure at a reference altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta z$ is the difference in altitude between the given and reference altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "and $H$ is the scale height of the atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives for this lab are to:\n",
    "1. Determine the scale height of the atmosphere\n",
    "2. Assess the relative efficacy of different methods of determining scale height of the atmosphere\n",
    "3. Produce high-quality figures\n",
    "4. Summarize findings in a slide deck that is designed to be read (not presented)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Familiarize yourself with sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using arduino microcontrollers with a pressure chip to measure the air pressure at different altitudes. These sensors have been pre-assembled and pre-programmed for you. Connect your sensors to a 9 V battery. If the screen does not turn on, press the small black reset button on the corner of the blue circuit board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the screen turns on, you should briefly see a diagnostic screen, then the date & time, and finally a screen with the pressure in mbar and a VOC (volatile organic compound) reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    858.52 mbar\n",
    "    voc=200.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reading should flash and update approximately every second. If your sensor is not working, notify Dr. Pagonis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a quick trip to another floor of Tracy Hall. Does the pressure reading respond corrrectly? i.e. is the pressure higher if you go down a floor? If so, you are ready to move on to Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure pressure as a function of altitude across campus. If leaving Tracy Hall is not an option then you can collect data from the top to the bottom of the building. You will need measurements at ten different altitudes, where each measurement includes:\n",
    "1. the pressure\n",
    "2. the altitude relative to sea level (or some other reference altitude)\n",
    "3. the measurement location\n",
    "If you are travelling across campus to make these measurements you can use tools such as CalTopo to get the altitude of a location relative to sea level\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a pandas dataframe and populate it with your data. \n",
    "- If your data is absolute altitudes, create a relative altitude column in your dataframe by subtracting off the minumum absolute altitude value: $\\Delta z = z - z_0$\n",
    "- Use pyplot to graph relative altitude (y) vs pressure measurements (x). This is a good time to check in with Dr. Pagonis to make sure the data is in good shape before proceeding."
