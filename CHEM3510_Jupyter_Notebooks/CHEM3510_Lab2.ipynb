    "# Environmental Chemistry Lab - TUV Calculator and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to use the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) calculator to model solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. We will also learn how to visualize our results using the Matplotlib library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: NCAR's TUV Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction to the TUV Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "- The TUV calculator is a radiative transfer model that calculates the intensity (actinic flux) of photons from the sun at a given point in the earth's atmosphere.\n",
    "- This is useful because the rate constants of many important reactions depend on actinic flux.\n",
    "- The TUV calculator is highly customizable. We will be exploring how light intensity varies with time of day, season, latitude, and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Using the TUV Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the TUV calculator's website: https://www.acom.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/Interactive_TUV/\n",
    "2. Input the required parameters (latitude, longitude, time of year, and altitude) and run the simulation.\n",
    "    - You can pick any location and time for this example\n",
    "    - In the third column (Sunlight), you want to select the `ACTINIC FLUX, SPECTRAL (quanta s-1 cm-2 nm-1)` checkbox, and deselect the `MOLECULAR PHOTOLYSIS FREQUENCIES (s-1)` checkbox \n",
    "3. Press `GO!`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model ran successfully you should see a table of actinic fluxes at different wavelengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let Dr. Pagonis know that you've reached this point, and then continue on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Importing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will use Python to import the data into a Pandas dataframe. This involves understanding the structure of the NCAR TUV API, and so I have already written this function. You simply need to import it using the code below"
