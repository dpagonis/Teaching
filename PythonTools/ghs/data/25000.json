PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The high solubility of cobalt nitrate makes it a common source of cobalt in metal-organic frameworks and polymers. It is also reduced to metallic cobalt or precipitated on various substrates for Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. Cobalt is a metallic element with the atomic number 27. It is found naturally in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals. In small amounts cobalt is an essential element for life, as it is part of vitamin B12. However, excess exposure is known to exhibit toxic effects. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia. (L1137,  L29, L30, L492)",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

A gamma camera was used to measure lung retention, while lung clearance was assessed by blood and excretion analysis. Physically and chemically uniform Co-57 particles were retained similarly in the lungs, although the retention of CO particles in the 0.3 to 2.7 micron range was greatly dependent on their physicochemical properties. /In dogs/ The primary clearance pathway was dissolution of the inhaled particles. The rate of dissolution was inversely proportional to the diameter of the /cobalt nitrate or oxide/ particle; depending on particle size, particle dissolution half time ranged from 6 to 80 days. After inhalation, most of the Co-57 was identified in the lungs, followed by muscles, bone, and skin. Less than 10 percent of the initial lung burden was present in the lungs of dogs long term, with a biological half life of 400 days. Dogs exposed to CN retained 90 percent of the body burden in the lung as late as 1050 and 1500 days after exposure, while the other dogs retained only 50 to 70 percent of the body burden in the lungs at 350 and 500 days after exposure. The presence of high concentrations of Co-57 in the trachea and upper respiratory tract at the time of death of the animals confirmed the long term retention of cobalt in some tissues.",

Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L1137, L29)",

The vessel interior must then be washed with water and purged with air. After purging the vessel's atmosphere with suitable instruments to ensure that no hazards from fire, explosion, oxygen deficiency, or dust inhalation exist. No one should enter a tank or vessel without first being equipped with an appropriate respirator and a secured lifeline or harness. Mechanical ventilation should be provided continuously when workers are inside the tank. At least one other worker similarly equipped with respiratory protection, lifeline, and harness should watch at all times from outside the vessel. Workers inside the tank must be able to communicate with those persons outside. Other workers must be available to assist in an emergency.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

It is used in manufacture of cobalt pigments and invisible inks; decorating stoneware and porcelain; preparation of catalysts; production of vitamin B12 supplements. Cobalt nitrate is an important source of high-purity cobalt for use in the electronics and related industries. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Repeated or prolonged contact may cause skin sensitization. Repeated or prolonged inhalation may cause asthma. Ingestion may cause effects on the bone marrow, heart and thyroid. ANIMAL STUDIES: After four daily injections of 0.03 g cobalt nitrate, the pancreas of guinea pigs showed an increase in number of endocrine islands. The majority of alpha cells were degranulated with nuclei surrounded by a colorless cytoplasm. When animals were allowed to recover after the last injection, islands returned to normal. Cobalt nitrate given to rats sc twice over 24 hr period increased erythropoietic activity of the serum by greater than 3-fold, decreased renal blood flow by 18%, and disrupted metabolism in kidney. Rats exposed to 6.44 mg cobalt/kg/day as cobalt nitrate in the drinking water showed an increased sensitivity and decreased maximal response to a cholinergic agonist.",

It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization. (L29) Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613)",

The localization of proteins of cellular contacts was detected by means of direct immunofluorescence. The authors have detected a decrease in, and destruction of cellular contact proteins and actin cytoskeleton after testing the effect of all allergens, while the most significant changes were detected in E-cadherin, vunkulin and actin filaments. Desmoplaktin and talin were less damaged. Potassium dichromate caused damage already in concentration of 1 ug/mL. A similar effect of the other two tested haptanes was brought about in concentration being 100-fold higher. The gained results indicate that the investigation of cellular contact proteins and actin cytoskeleton of cultivated human keratinocytes can possibly become a part of the testing of allergy-triggering potential of chemical substances.",

Lymphocytes from 35 of these patients showed a significantly greater response than that of the controls. The response occurred in the T enriched population and was monocyte dependent. The strength of the in vivo serial dilution test results did not correlate well with the height of in vitro responses. Lymphocytes from 3 nickel and/or chromium sensitive patients failed to respond to stimulation with cobalt compounds thus confirming the specificity of the reaction. The DNA synthesis test seems to be a reliable in vitro method to aid in the diagnosis of cobalt sensitivity.",

The majority of alpha cells were degranulated with nuclei surrounded by a colorless cytoplasm. When animals were allowed to recover after the last injection, islands returned to normal. Injections of colloidal cobalt produced a slight increase in number of endocrine islands. Alpha and beta cells were normal in size. After six daily injections, the pancreas showed a definite increase in number and size of islands. The author concludes that  cobalt-nitrate is identical in action to cobaltous-chloride but is far less toxic than  cobaltous-chloride.",
