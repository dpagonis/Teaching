PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Sodium hydroxide is used to manufacture soaps, rayon, paper, explosives, dyestuffs, and petroleum products. It is also used in processing cotton fabric, laundering and bleaching, metal cleaning and processing, oxide coating, electroplating, and electrolytic extracting. It is commonly present in commercial drain and oven cleaners.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Readily absorbs moisture from the air to give caustic semi-solids that attack aluminum and zinc with the evolution of flammable hydrogen gas. Catalyzes the polymerization of acetaldehyde and other polymerizable compounds; these reactions can occur violently, for example, acrolein polymerizes with extreme violence when put in contact with alkaline materials such as sodium hydroxide [Chem. Safety Data Sheet SD-85 1961]. Reacts with great violence with phosphorus pentaoxide when initiated by local heating [Mellor 8 Supp.3:406 1971]. Contact (as a drying agent) with tetrahydrofuran, which often contains peroxides, may be hazardous---explosions have occurred in such a use of the chemically similar potassium hydroxide [NSC Newsletter Chem. Soc. 1967]. Mixing with any of the following substances in a closed container caused the temperature and pressure to increase: glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, acrolein, chlorohydrin, chlorosulfonic acid, ethylene cyanohydrin, glyoxal, hydrochloric acid (36%), hydrofluoric acid (48.7%), nitric acid (70%), oleum, propiolactone, sulfuric acid (96%) [NFPA 1991]. Accidental contact between a caustic cleaning solution (probably containing sodium hydroxide) and Pentol caused a violent explosion. [MCA Case History 363(1964)]. Heating with a mixture of methyl alcohol and trichlorobenzene during an attempted synthesis led to a sudden increase in pressure and an explosion [MCA Guide for Safety Appendix 3 1972]. Hot and/or concentrated NaOH can cause hydroquinone to decompose exothermically at elevated temperature. (NFPA Pub. 491M, 1975, 385)",

Five of the callers sustained injuries from their exposure, and three of these sustained burns, one in the oral cavity and one in the eye. None suffered permanent sequelae, but the potential for such is considerable.

A standard esophageal alkaline burn was produced by the application of 10% sodium hydroxide to the distal esophagus in an in vivo rat model. Fifty-six female rats were allocated into three groups: Group BC (baseline control, n = 8) rats were uninjured and untreated, Group PC (positive control, n = 24) rats were injured but untreated and Group EPO (erythropoietin-treated, n = 24) rats were injured and given subcutaneous erythropoietin (1,000 IU/kg per day), 15 min, 24, and 48 hr after administration of the NaOH solution. Six animals from Group PC and six from Group EPO were killed at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr after application of NaOH to the esophagus. All of animals in Group BC were killed 4 hr after exposure to 0.9% NaCl. Oxidative damage was assessed by measuring levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in homogenized samples of esophageal tissue. Histologic damage to esophageal tissue was scored by a single pathologist blind to groups. MDA levels in the BC and EPO groups were significantly lower than those in the PC group (p < 0.05). CAT and SOD activities, and NO levels in the BC and EPO groups were significantly higher than in the PC group (p < 0.05). Esophageal tissue damage measured at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr after NaOH application was significantly less in the EPO group than in the PC group (p < 0.05). When administered early after an esophageal burn induced by 10% sodium hydroxide in this rat model, erythropoietin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, as measured by biochemical markers and histologic scoring.",

Tissue hydroxyproline (HP)  concentrations in the injured area were assessed at 14 days after the administration of sodium hydroxide. The groups received either systemic melatonin or normal saline. There were two, non-ischemic, sham control groups treated with or without melatonin. LPO products, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenal (4-HDA), increased immediately after the administration of sodium hydroxide; this indicates the participation of free radicals in the development of damage. Melatonin diminished the oxidative response and the amount of HP in the late phase of the lesion.

A standard esophageal alkaline burn was produced by the application of 10% sodium hydroxide to the distal esophagus in an in vivo rat model. Fifty-six female rats were allocated into three groups: Group BC (baseline control, n = 8) rats were uninjured and untreated, Group PC (positive control, n = 24) rats were injured but untreated and Group EPO (erythropoietin-treated, n = 24) rats were injured and given subcutaneous erythropoietin (1,000 IU/kg per day), 15 min, 24, and 48 hr after administration of the NaOH solution. Six animals from Group PC and six from Group EPO were killed at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr after application of NaOH to the esophagus. All of animals in Group BC were killed 4 hr after exposure to 0.9% NaCl. Oxidative damage was assessed by measuring levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in homogenized samples of esophageal tissue. Histologic damage to esophageal tissue was scored by a single pathologist blind to groups. MDA levels in the BC and EPO groups were significantly lower than those in the PC group (p < 0.05). CAT and SOD activities, and NO levels in the BC and EPO groups were significantly higher than in the PC group (p < 0.05). Esophageal tissue damage measured at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr after NaOH application was significantly less in the EPO group than in the PC group (p < 0.05). When administered early after an esophageal burn induced by 10% sodium hydroxide in this rat model, erythropoietin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, as measured by biochemical markers and histologic scoring.",

Lipid peroxidation (LPO) products were then measured at the following times: 0, 1, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after treatment. Tissue hydroxyproline (HP)  concentrations in the injured area were assessed at 14 days after the administration of sodium hydroxide. The groups received either systemic melatonin or normal saline. There were two, non-ischemic, sham control groups treated with or without melatonin. LPO products, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenal (4-HDA), increased immediately after the administration of sodium hydroxide; this indicates the participation of free radicals in the development of damage. Melatonin diminished the oxidative response and the amount of HP in the late phase of the lesion. Melatonin reduced oxidative damage in the early phase of the esophageal burns induced by sodium hydroxide.",

These results confirm previous studies and strongly suggest that ascorbic acid presents a potential for use in the alkali-burned human eye.",

Esophageal motor function in 21 children (7.5 +/- 2.9 years) with caustic strictures /was assessed/. /All patients had ingested sodium hydroxide./ Esophageal manometry was performed using a water-infusion system interfaced with a polygraph and displayed on a computer screen. The data were compared with those obtained from 9 healthy children. Radionuclide transit was determined by studying deglutition of a single bolus of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate in 10 mL of water. Non-peristaltic low-amplitude and long-duration waves were the most common findings detected in patients with strictures longer than 20% of esophageal length (N = 11). Compared with the control group, these patients presented lower mean amplitude and longer mean duration of waves (24.4 +/- 11.2 vs 97.9 +/- 23.7 mmHg, P < 0.05, and 6.7 +/- 2.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.1 s, P < 0.05, respectively). Six patients presented low-amplitude waves just below the constricted site. Ten children presented delayed esophageal transit. There was an association between dysphagia and abnormalities on manometry (P = 0.02) and between symptoms and scintigraphy data (P = 0.01). Dysphagia in caustic strictures is due to esophageal motility abnormalities, which are closely related to the scarred segment.",

Enucleated bovine and porcine (n = 59 each) eyes were used for exposure to sodium, ammonium, and calcium hydroxide, respectively, /in three different concentrations 11 M, 6 M, or 0.25 M and were splashed onto the eye using a syringe.  Approximately 5 mL each alkali solution was splashed onto the fully exposed cornea, ensuring that the entire cornea was covered. Each assigned to a predesignated time interval (30 sec, 60 sec, 12 min, 30 min, 8 hr, and 24 hr) for exposure and were immediately washed in water./  Eyes were subjected to fluorescein staining, 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) labeling. Excised cornea was subjected to protein extraction, spectrophotometric determination of protein amount, dynamic light scattering and SDS-PAGE profiling, mass spectrometric protein identification, and iTRAQ-labeled quantification. Select identified proteins were subjected to Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Alkali exposure resulted in lower protein extractability from corneal tissue. Elevated aggregate formation was found with strong alkali exposure (sodium hydroxide>ammonium, calcium hydroxide), even with a short duration of exposure compared with controls. The protein yield after exposure varied as a function of post exposure time. Protein profiles changed because of alkali exposure. Concentration and strength of the alkali affected the profile change significantly. Mass spectrometry identified 15 proteins from different bands with relative quantification. Plexin D1 was identified for the first time in the cornea at a protein level that was further confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Exposure to alkaline chemicals results in predictable and reproducible changes in corneal protein profile. Stronger alkali, longer durations, or both, of exposure resulted in lower yields and significant protein profile changes compared with controls.",

Adult New Zealand rabbit eyes were burned with 1 M NaOH for 1 min. Normal eyes were used as control. Samples from aqueous humor and perchloric acid extracts of the cornea and lens were analyzed on a NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for protons. Metabolites were quantified by comparing peak area with an added internal standard, TSP (3'-trimethylsilylpropinate-2,2,3,3-d4). Alkali burn of corneal surface causes immediate changes in concentration of many water-soluble metabolites in the anterior segment. Even as far away as the lens a significant increase in lactate was found. Cornea showed a significant increase in glucose and a significant decrease in hypo-taurine concentration. Most changes were observed in aqueous humor, with significant increases in succinate, creatine, scyllo- and myo-inositol and a significant decrease in citrate concentration. Furthermore, a small decrease in ascorbate concentration in aqueous humor was observed.",

To study morphological and functional alterations of the esophagus in rabbits submitted to esophageal infusion of caustic soda (NaOH). The 88 rabbits studied were divided into 4 groups: G1 (n=22) were submitted to esophageal infusion with distilled water. G2, G3, and G4 were submitted to esophageal infusion of 2%, 4% and 6% NaOH respectively. Morphological alterations were studied in 12 animals from each group and manometric alterations in the remaining 10. An analysis was made of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, number and amplitude of contractions in the distal third of the esophagus. These studies were performed before (moment M1) and at 30 min, 6 hr, and 24 hr after (moments M2, M3, and M4, respectively) esophageal infusion. Morphological evaluation: G1 - no alterations; G2 - edema, hyperemia, and ecdysis; G3 - enlarged calibre of esophagus, ulcers, ecdysis of mucosa; G4 - lesions similar to G3, but more intense, areas of extensive hemorrhage at M3 and M4. Functional evaluation: LES was higher at M2; the number of distal third lower esophageal contractions in G3, and G4 was lower; and the contraction amplitude was lower in G4. ... Esophageal infusion with NaOH caused lesions in the esophageal wall, with gravity proportional to solution concentration.  Infusion caused LES spasm at M2, and reduced both contraction number and amplitude in the distal third of the esophagus.",
