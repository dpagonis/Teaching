When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

A catechol metabolite of PT, hydroxyphenolphthalein (PT-CAT), was recently identified and may be the molecular species responsible for at least part of the toxicity/carcinogenicity of PT. We hypothesize that PT-CAT inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and therefore potentiates genotoxicity by either PT-CAT itself or the endogenous catechol estrogens (CEs) in susceptible tissues. The present studies were conducted to determine the effects of PT treatment and PT-CAT itself on the COMT-mediated metabolism of 4- and 2-hydroxyestradiol both in vitro and in vivo. Female mice were treated with PT (50 mg/kg/d) for 21 days and then euthanized. PT-CAT concentration in urine reached plateau levels by 7 days of exposure. An O-methylated metabolite of PT-CAT was detected in feces. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PT treatment resulted in an increase in free CEs, which are normally cleared by COMT and a concurrent decrease in the capacity of hepatic catechol clearance by COMT. In vitro, PT-CAT was a substrate of COMT, with kinetic properties within the range measured with endogenous substrates. PT-CAT was an extremely potent mixed-type inhibitor of the O-methylation of the catechol estrogens, with 90-300 nM IC50s.",

Eye contact may result in edema of the eyelids and conjunctival ecchymoses. It may also result in irritation, redness and pain. It has occasionally caused albuminuria and hemoglobinurea. It may also cause skin rash. Other symptoms include pink coloring of the urine and feces, allergic reactions including fixed-drug eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (resembles lupus erythematosus), osteomalacia, protein-losing gastroenteropathy, and fluid and electrolyte deficits. Exposure has also caused cerebral and pulmonary edema, oliguria and severe acidosis. Hypothermia has also been reported. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps, cardiac and respiratory distress, lack of sphincter control, flaccid paralysis, fixed mydriasis, intense cyanosis, undetectable blood pressure or pulse, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and bullous lesions on the hands, lips, mouth and tongue."

The two lowest concentrations delivered doses of phenolphthalein that were approximately 0.5-1.5 times the recommended human dose based on a mg/sq m body surface area comparison. The incidence of malignant lymphoma of the thymus was significantly increased in heterozygous p53- deficient female mice given the two higher doses. Atypical thymic hyperplasia, seen in 3/20 animals at 750 mg/kg, 3/20 at 3000 mg/kg and 5/20 at 12,000 ppm, was considered to represent proliferative change preceding lymphoma. The incidence of atypical hyperplasia or malignant lymphoma was increased in animals at 750 ppm. The incidence of malignant lymphomas was significantly increased at the two highest doses (0/19 in controls and 1/20, 0/20, 2/20, 17/20 (p < 0.01) and 14/20 (p < 0.01) at the five doses, respectively). Loss of the p53 wild-type allele was found in 2/2 thymic lymphomas from animals at 750 mg/kg, 13/13 at 200 mg/kg and 6/6 at 12 000 mg/kg.",

Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to phenolphthalein (98% to 99% pure) in feed for ... 2 years. ... 2 YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were given 0, 12,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm phenolphthalein (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg phenolphthalein/kg body weight to males and 500, 1,000, or 2,500 mg/kg to females) in feed for 2 yr. 2 YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were given 0, 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 ppm phenolphthalein (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 300, 600, or 1,200 mg phenolphthalein/kg body weight to males and 400, 800, or 1,500 mg/kg to females) in feed for 2 yr. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 yr feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of phenolphthalein in male F344/N rats based on markedly increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and of renal tubule adenomas and adenomas or carcinomas (combined). There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of phenolphthalein in female F344/N rats based on the increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla in the 12,000 ppm group and of benign or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined) in the 12,000 and 25,000 ppm groups. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of phenolphthalein in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcomas and of malignant lymphomas of thymic origin. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of phenolphthalein in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcomas, malignant lymphomas of all types, lymphomas of thymic origin, and benign sex cord stromal tumors of the ovary.",

A dose-finding study was not conducted; rather based on information available in the literature, 0.1, 0.7, & 3.0% levels were tested in the reproductive study. For F0 evaluation, male & female mice were continuously exposed for a 7 day precohabitation & a 98 day cohabitation period (Task 2). Subsequently, the control & 0.7% groups were used in a cross-over mating trial (Task 3) to determine the sex affected by chemical treatment. The F1 generation from control, 0.1, & 0.7% groups were also evaluated (Task 4). Phenolphthalein with increasing dose & duration of exposure, caused a significant reduction in fertility, with a decr in the number of litters/fertile pair in the 0.7 & 3.0% groups. Parental body weights were not affected by phenolphthalein treatment. The cumulative days to litter values were also increased in the 0.7 & 3% treated animals. In the cross-over mating trial, the treated females mated with control males delivered fewer live pups. There were no adverse effects in the litters from treated males mated with control females. At terminal necropsy, male kidneys were enlarged & right epididymis & testis weights were significantly lower than controls. Sperm morphology & vaginal cytology evaluation (SMVCE) results were parallel to subchronic study results in B6C3F1 mice; both sperm count (Task 3) & incidence of abnormal sperm (Tasks 3 & 4) were adversely affected. Reproductive performance of treated males, however, was similar to the corresponding control males. The middle dose group was chosen for Task 3 crossover in the expectation (based on several previous RACB studies) that use of the high dose would indicate that both sexes were affected. Similar to Task 2 results, fertility declined in F1 mice receiving 0.7% phenolphthalein. The number of live F2 pups/litter decreased as well. Also, in the F1 males in the 0.7% group, testis & epididymis weights were decreased, & the incidence of abnormal sperm was increased. Pathologic lesions in F1 males were similar to those found in the parental males. Thus, phenolphthalein, administered in the feed at concns up to 3.0%, was clearly toxic to murine reproduction in both generations of treated mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.7X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phenolphthalein will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase phenolphthalein will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, phenolphthalein is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 490. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.0X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, phenolphthalein is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 14 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
