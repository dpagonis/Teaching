When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Alkyl nitrates, including n-propyl nitrate, are also commonly formed in the atmosphere through the reaction of the corresponding alkyl peroxy radical and nitric oxide. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 23.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-propyl nitrate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-propyl nitrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 days. n-Propyl nitrate is expected to undergo direct photolysis in the environment with half-lives ranging from 8 to 40 days. If released to soil, n-propyl nitrate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.27X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may also be an important fate process based on the vapor pressure. No biodegradation data were located for n-propyl nitrate; however, biodegradation data for nitroglycerin (1,2,3-propanetriol, trinitrate) suggest that alkyl nitrates may undergo biodegradation in acclimated soils and water. If released into water, n-propyl nitrate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 4 days, respectively. Although hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for n-propyl nitrate, photolysis in sunlit surface water may occur since this compound undergoes direct photolysis. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to n-propyl nitrate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-propyl nitrate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to low levels of n-propyl nitrate via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase n-propyl nitrate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.3X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Based upon its UV cross section, the direct photolysis half-life of n-propyl nitrate has been estimated to range from about 8 to 40 days depending upon the angle and intensity of the sun(4).",

Based upon its UV cross section, the direct photolysis half-life of n-propyl nitrate has been estimated to range from about 8 to 40 days depending upon the angle and intensity of the sun(3). n-Propyl nitrate is not expected to undergo hydrolysis readily since it lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Nitroglycerin (1,2,3-propanetriol, trinitrate), was reported to have a hydrolysis half-life of about 10 years at neutral conditions(4), but the half-life was about 37 days under alkaline (pH 9) conditions(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
